# Code Challenge for Software Engineer
Welcome to the coles software engineer code challenge! The purpose of this challenge is to help us assess your technical skills. We know that you have limited time to devote to this task and may not be able to provide the as complete solution as you would given more time, so we suggest you focus on the core requirements first, then any additional features if you have time left over and also document your assumptions and thoughts.
# Task
Here at Coles like many people we love our Music.

We have a small project to demonstrate your skills.

Create a restful API application with at least one endpoint that when supplied with the artist / band name will search the MusicBrainz.org service and return a response.

The return payload should be a collection of possible artist matches, if there is more than one possible match.
Or a collection of all the releases for an artist if there is a single artist with that name.

Here is the api reference for your convenience - https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Development/

In terms of artifacts we expect to receive from you: You have the freedom to submit what you would feel will be a good way to demonstrate what
great engineering looks like, in your mind.

# Deliverables
## Minimum Requirement
Latest LTS JDK version and above

Springboot to provide RESTful service

# Evaluation Criteria
Evaluation is based on clean coding skills, design & problem-solving skills and the use of modern technologies.

# Submission
A private repo link will be provided and accessible from your email address. Please commit your solution into the repo, and document the solution, assumptions, design decisions.  Also Feel free to also include what else you would have done given more time.
